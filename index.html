    <h1 class="closing" strong>How to cook a Carl Fried Egg</h1 stong>
        <p>This is my special twist on your standard morning egg. I have been known to make this for a light supper once in a while. 
            It starts out like a sunny side up. However, you do not get that thick yoke that some folks don't like.</p>

        <br>

<h3 class="topic"><strong>Needed Items</strong></h3>
    <ul>
<li>One egg - (Two eggs used in photo above.)</li>
<li>Small non-stick pan</li>
<li>Stove</li>
</ul>

<br>


<h3 class="topic"><strong>Directions</strong></h3> 
    <ol>
    <li>Pre-heat pan and melt some quality butter.</li>
    <li>Rinse off your egg.  I typically run my hands over it while under running water.  (You don't really know who touched your eggs at the store.)  I love cooking with "bloom eggs", but you need to know the farmer well.</li>
    <li>Wiggle pan to make sure butter is coating entire bottom and the sides.</li>
    <li>Crack the egg and gently break into the pan.</li>
    
    <p>

        <li class="topic">    <strong>- Here is Carl's secret. -</strong></li> 
        <li>    Grab a fork</li>
        <li>    Gently slide the fork tines down into the Albumin (thick part of egg white). 
        </li>
        <li>    Turn the fork so that you are gently stabbing into the yoke about half way from the bottom.</li>
        <li>    Gently wiggle the fork so that the yoke can bleed out into the albumin.</li>
        <li>    Now, gently reverse out of the yoke and then the albumin.</li>
        <li>    Now, the yoke will bleed into the albumin. </li>
        <li><strong>However,</strong> it should stay <topic>inside the albumin</topic> and NOT bleed out over the pan by itself.!!</li>
        </ul>
        
    </p>
    <li>At this stage I usually add a pinch of pepper and a pinch of celery salt.</li>
    <li>As the egg(s) are cooking, check the edges occasionally by running your fork around the edges.  Hopefully, the egg will firm up but stay free from sticking.</li>
    <li>Watch the eggs now.  As they cook, they will begin to whiten and firm up.  Before they finish up you want to flip them. </li>
    <li>It won't take long now.  When the eggs first flip, the loose uncooked part will tend to stick to the pan.  Give the pan a jiggle and twist regularly.  Once the eggs move freely again you are moments from finished.</li>
    <li>Grab your plate.  Bring your pan over to it.  Tip both so that you roll the eggs back over as they land on the plate.</li>
    <li>Optional:  Decorate/season with ketchup as shown in the photo.</li>
    
</ol>

    <p class="closing">     Now, go have some fun with this.  Give it a few tries. </p>
    <p class="closing">    Hopefully you will find that it is a nicely different taste to your normal sunny side up egg.
    <p class="closing">     I thank you for your time.</p>
