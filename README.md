# Recipe  
This was my first real world looking webpage.  
It was an early assignment from FEWD (Front End Web Design) class.  
Besides being a nice early accomplishment, it is also a cool way to show the awesomeness of a "Carl Fried Egg".  
The photo at the very bottom of the page is a "web-grab" (I think that is what they called it in class).   
All other photos and the short video were done by me.
